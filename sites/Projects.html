  I'm currently working on an iOS application that is in it's very early development stages. The reason I chose this project was to stretch my creative muscles and 
  put my knowledge of the Swift language into pratice and test my ability to create a game that is multifaceted.
  This game will take the style of the typical dungeon clearing game, with a main storyline that the player can progress through in
  a closed world format.

<p>
I'm also working on a simple GUI in python, specifically designed to format word documents and calculate prices. It will work by allowing users to input labor hours, price per unit, 
and number of units. The program will then take these elements, calculate the job cost and format it into a word document (.docx file), allowing for easy editing of the final product. 
This project is originally designed to be a personalized 
system for a small construction company to help streamline the time taken to create proposals and deliver them to customers. After completetion, I intend to make this project more generalized,
creating a way to choose between preset styles and create personalized styles and formats.
