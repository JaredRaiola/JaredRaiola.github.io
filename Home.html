  <h3 class="w3-sepia">About Me</h3>

<p class="body">
  I am a sophomore attending <b>Georgia Institute of Technology</b> majoring in <b>computer science</b>.
  My hobbies include hiking, skiing, traveling, playing music and playing with dogs! Throughout my life, I've been raised to help others and dedicate myself
  fully to any project that is at hand. Due to this, I've taken a leadership program in Washington D.C. (People To People), and have performed community service in Boston and New Orleans, to help rebuild 
  communities in both areas. Throughout my high school career at Mahopac High School I've led my school's sax quartet, participated in the jazz and marching bands, created a taco club, and became the captain 
  of the tennis team. In college, I've joined the iOS development club, orgT caving, and Delta Upsilon fraternity. I actively participate in all of these organizations and have taken a leadership role in my 
  fraternity as Assistant House Manager. One of my major goals in life is to travel the world, as I believe it's very important to learn about and be tolerant of other cultures and idealogies.
  Thank you for taking the time to check out my website and learn a little bit more about me! Here you you'll find links my GitHub, LinkedIn, Resume, and my Projects.

  <h3 class="w3-sepia">Why I Chose to do Computer Science</h3>

<p class="body">
I’ve been interested in computers ever since childhood, but I really decided upon it as a career choice in my senior year at Mahopac High School, 
where I took my first programming class in C++.
Since then, I’ve been hooked. I love the challenge of learning new languages and how machines communicate with each other.
I'm very interested in delving further into the field of Cyber Security and mobile development, perhaps even a combination of the two. I believe that mobile devices are the future, as technology advances.
